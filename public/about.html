<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a disabled veteran that has been blessed with getting help from others and I feel I have something I can offer and
also fulfill a dream to give back to those that give and has given to me in my times of need. These are the ways I can
help you with your website.</p>

<h2>We believe in hard work and dedication</h2>
<p>Here their is no guess at who is build ing and maintaining your site. Reason you are a part of the elite 30 I call it. I
will only have a few clients so I can ensure the highest quality service.</p>

<h3>We stop at nothing</h3>
<p>When it comes to websites we are not equipped with paying tens of thousands a year for an IT department, what if I told
you for just 2400 a year you can sleep well knowing your site has 24./7 protection with updates and backups.</p>

<h3>We love to explore</h3>
<p>We are not biased to a product or plugin. We want our clients to use the best tools possible, we test and review allot
of web development ad design products.</p>

<h3>We keep it simple</h3>
<p>We only give our clients what they need and not everything under the moon. We also train the end user how to update
their own sites.</p>

<h3>We take it step-by-step</h3>
<p>We understand that the first time you see your site your going to be in awe and later want to change a thing or two,
with us you can ask for a couple free updates every month when needed and a very discounted fee if you need major
changes.</p>
